help me craft a PRD document for these files (ignore the blank ones and "probleminterviewscript.md"). ask me questions to fill in the missing gaps. start by explaining what a PRD document is and why it is needed in the first step in app development.

What is a PRD Document?
A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a formal document that defines:

What you are building
Who you are building it for
Why it needs to exist
How it should behave and function
Why is it the First Step?
Before writing a single line of code, a PRD acts as the single source of truth for your entire project. It:

Prevents scope creep — stops you from randomly adding features mid-build
Forces clarity — you can't build what you can't clearly describe
Aligns everyone — designers, developers, and stakeholders all reference the same doc
Saves time — catching a design flaw on paper is infinitely cheaper than catching it in code
Think of it like an architect's blueprint. You don't start pouring concrete before the blueprint is done.

What I Can See From Your Files
From your existing PRD folder, I can pull together a solid foundation. Here's what you already have:

Section	Status
Problem Statement	✅ problem.md
User Personas	✅ user-persona-1.md, user-persona-2.md
Value Propositions	✅ uniquevalueproposition1.md, uniquevalueproposition2.md
Features / Requirements	❌ Missing
Success Metrics	❌ Missing
Scope & Non-Goals	❌ Missing
Tech Stack	❌ Missing
My Questions for You
To fill the gaps, please answer as many of these as you can:

What platform is this app for — web, mobile (iOS/Android), or desktop?
What does the app actually do at its core? Describe it in 1–2 sentences like you're explaining it to a friend.
What are the 3–5 must-have features you want in the first version?
What would make this app a success? (e.g., "Sam uses it every day" or "reduces missed deadlines by X%")
What is explicitly OUT of scope? What are you not building?
Do you have a name for the app yet?
What's your target timeline for finishing the first version?
