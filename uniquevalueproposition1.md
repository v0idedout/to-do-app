This final piece—the **Focus Filter**—is the "secret sauce." By defaulting to a narrow, high-relevance window, the app actively combats the "sense of dread" Sam feels when overwhelmed. You aren't just managing time; you are managing Sam's **cognitive load**.

We have everything we need to define the strategy.

# Solutions / UVP

### The Unique Value Proposition

**The only energy-aware scheduler that protects student performance by matching high-stakes tasks with high-energy windows.** It eliminates the "mental math" of planning, allowing students to focus on the quality of their work rather than the dread of the deadline.

### The Core Solutions

* **Energy-Baseline Scheduling:** Unlike static planners, the app builds a "Peak vs. Gap" calendar during onboarding. It identifies high-exhaustion days and automatically anchors deep-work tasks to "Gap Days" where the student has the highest cognitive capacity.
* **Predictive Offloading (The Auto-Pilot):** Students input raw deadlines, and the app generates a fluctuating, pre-determined work schedule. It handles the "look ahead" logic, so the user never has to calculate how much time they have left.
* **Fatigue-Sensitive Rescheduling:** If a task isn't completed, the app doesn't just "overdue" it. It intelligently shifts the task to the next available low-exhaustion window, providing a gentle reminder without cluttering an already "Peak" day.
* **The Dread-Reduction Interface:** To prevent "triage paralysis," the dashboard defaults to a filtered view of only "Yesterday's Carryover" and "Tomorrow's Priorities." This keeps the focus on immediate execution while hiding the daunting weekly load behind an optional toggle.
* **Dynamic Deadline Triage:** The system automatically recalculates the schedule based on real-time busy periods, ensuring that the student is always working on the most critical task that fits their current energy level.
