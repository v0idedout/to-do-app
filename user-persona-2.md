### **Bio**

kuvi, is a 9th grader with no after-school clubs and all the time in the world before 10PM. and a third of that time goes to having a mental break from school. recently they find themselves struggling to focus on work, usually at school they perform well, but they find it hard to start to get tasks done at home. They like to work on things one at a time, and their mind often shuts down when faced with overlapping tasks to do.

### **Daily Schedule & Habits**

* **~3:30 PM-5:00 PM:** arrives home. winds down on their phone.
* **5:00 PM:** start working. give themselves a little later if they can't get to focus immediately.
* **7:30 PM-8:00 PM:** either the time they start to lock in or the time they start to lose their focus.
* **9:00 PM-10:00 PM:** go to sleep, later if they can arrive late tomorrow, earlier if their mom tells them to sleep.

### **Current Systems**

* **Mental Processing:** can remember to do things, but doesn't trust themselves to remember EVERYTHING due to having worse for wear memory.
* **Phone Alarms:** usually a very blunt way to remind themselves if they need to do something. also helpful for very general things.
* **Calendar App:** they like to have reminders on calendars for sorting out big projects really ahead of time.
* **Context Switching:** if work is frustrating them, sometimes they like to do a (break,work,break,work) strategy. works like a charm, but it's a bad habit since it means losing more time for the task at hand.
* **Background Noise:** used to listen to music while they worked, but recently it's been less effective.

### **Goals**

* to have a clear, pre-determined path for multiple projects.
* to visualize which task to finish first based on deadlines and time spans.
* to lower the amount of time spent on smaller tasks to focus on the bigger projects.

### **Frustrations & Pain Points**

* **Low Energy Focus:** struggling to resist digital distractions, often getting sidetracked.
* **Multitasking Incapacity:** can't work on multiple things at once to generate quality work.
* **Fragmented Systems:** the system currently used works, but doesn't overlap well to cover all their assignments, plus it's annoying to set up.
