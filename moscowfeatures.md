# SRS Feature List

## Context

**Problem Statement:**
pj/null is a 9th grader with unstructured after-school time who needs a pre-determined, one-task-at-a-time schedule that tells them exactly what to work on next, because their mind shuts down when faced with overlapping deadlines and their fragmented system of alarms and calendars doesn't give them a clear, prioritized path — leading to delayed starts, lost time, and work that doesn't reflect what they're actually capable of.

**Target User:**
A student (grades 9–11) with adequate free time but low task-initiation energy, who struggles to start and sequence homework at home due to mental fatigue and overlapping deadlines, and needs a low-friction system that removes the decision of "what do I do first" so they can focus on one thing at a time and actually get it done. *(Substitute: Sam — a high-stakes junior facing a similar prioritization and scheduling gap under heavier time constraints.)*

## Must Have

- Users can create a task with a title, subject, and due date so all assignments are captured in one place.
- Users can set their "Peak Days" and "Gap Days" in a weekly schedule so the app understands when they actually have free time to do deep work.
- Users can mark a task as complete so their list stays current and they get a sense of progress.
- Users receive an automatically generated suggested work schedule that distributes tasks across their available free windows before each deadline.
- Users can quickly add a task in under 10 seconds from a single input field so the app never feels like more work than it saves.
- Users can set a task's priority level (high / medium / low) so the app surfaces the most important work first when energy is limited.

## Should Have

- Users can assign a rough time estimate to a task (e.g., "~2 hours") so the suggested schedule can fit tasks into realistic windows.
- Users receive deadline reminder notifications (push or in-app) at a set time before an assignment is due so nothing falls through the cracks.
- Users can view all their tasks grouped by subject or class so they can get a subject-level sense of their workload at a glance.

## Could Have

- Users can break a large project into smaller sub-tasks so an overwhelming assignment feels approachable and can be spread across multiple days.
- Users can run a "Focus Mode" session that hides everything except the single current task so they can reduce the mental overhead of seeing their full list while working.
- Users can view an upcoming-week overview on a home screen so they can see at a glance what's coming without having to mentally calculate it themselves.

## Won't Have
(cannot add anything i don't know how to build)

- login screen
- Users can sync the app with their existing phone calendar so they don't have to re-enter extracurricular commitments or already-known deadlines.
- Users can share or export their weekly task schedule as an image or PDF so they can print it out or share it with a parent or teacher.
- Users can log how long they actually spent on a task after completing it so the app can improve future time estimates over time.
