It sounds like you're diving into the "empathy" phase of UX design, which is where the best apps are born. To build a to-do app that high schoolers actually use (instead of just downloading and forgetting), you need to uncover the friction in their current routine.

Since we’re avoiding hypothetical "wouldn't it be cool if..." questions, here are five questions designed to get your peer talking about their actual habits and headaches.

### The Interview Scripts

1. **The Context**
"Walk me through how you kept track of your assignments and commitments yesterday. From the moment you got to school until you went to sleep, how did you remember what you had to do?"
* *Goal: To see if they use paper, digital notes, or just "mental storage."*


2. **The Frustration**
"Think back to a time recently when you forgot a deadline or felt completely overwhelmed by your workload. What specifically made that moment difficult to manage?"
* *Goal: To identify the 'breaking point' in their current system.*


3. **The Workaround**
"When you realize you have a massive project or a busy week ahead, what’s the first thing you do to organize yourself? Have you tried any specific apps or methods in the past?"
* *Goal: To find out what tools they’ve already vetted (and why they might be looking for something else).*


4. **The Insight**
"You mentioned using [their current method]. What is the most annoying thing about that process that you just 'put up with' right now?"
* *Goal: To find the 'hidden' pain points that aren't obvious at first glance.*


5. **The External Pressure**
"Tell me about a time you had to coordinate a task with a group or a teacher. How did you manage that communication alongside your own personal to-do list?"
* *Goal: To see if the 'struggle' is internal organization or external collaboration.*

### Pro-Tips for the Interview

* **Embrace the Silence:** After they answer, wait a few seconds. Often, people add the most important "insight" right after they think they're done talking.
* **The "Why" Drill:** If they say something is "hard," ask "Why was that the hardest part?" to get to the root cause.
* **Watch for Emotion:** If they sigh, laugh, or look stressed when talking about a specific task, you’ve found a major pain point.
