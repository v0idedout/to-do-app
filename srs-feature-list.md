# SRS Feature List

---

## Context

**Problem Statement:**
Sam is an ambitious, high-achieving student who needs a pre-determined schedule that aligns tasks with their actual free windows because mental math fails during peak-day exhaustion, leading to a performance gap where their work doesn't reflect their true capabilities.

**Target User:**
A time-constrained, high-cognitive-load student (grades 9–11) who struggles to start or prioritize work at home due to exhaustion and overlapping deadlines, and needs a low-friction system that does the "looking ahead" for them so they can focus on quality when they actually have the energy.

## Must Have

- Users can create a task with a title, subject, and due date so all assignments are captured in one place.
- Users can set their "Peak Days" and "Gap Days" in a weekly schedule so the app understands when they actually have free time to do deep work.
- Users can mark a task as complete so their list stays current and they get a sense of progress.
- Users receive an automatically generated suggested work schedule that distributes tasks across their available free windows before each deadline.
- Users can quickly add a task in under 10 seconds from a single input field so the app never feels like more work than it saves.
- Users can set a task's priority level (high / medium / low) so the app surfaces the most important work first when energy is limited.

## Should Have

- Users can assign a rough time estimate to a task (e.g., "~2 hours") so the suggested schedule can fit tasks into realistic windows.
- Users receive deadline reminder notifications (push or in-app) at a set time before an assignment is due so nothing falls through the cracks.
- Users can view all their tasks grouped by subject or class so they can get a subject-level sense of their workload at a glance.

## Could Have

- Users can break a large project into smaller sub-tasks so an overwhelming assignment feels approachable and can be spread across multiple days.
- Users can run a "Focus Mode" session that hides everything except the single current task so they can reduce the mental overhead of seeing their full list while working.
- Users can view an upcoming-week overview on a home screen so they can see at a glance what's coming without having to mentally calculate it themselves.

## Won't Have
(cannot add anything i don't know how to build)

- login screen
- Users can sync the app with their existing phone calendar so they don't have to re-enter extracurricular commitments or already-known deadlines.
- Users can share or export their weekly task schedule as an image or PDF so they can print it out or share it with a parent or teacher.
- Users can log how long they actually spent on a task after completing it so the app can improve future time estimates over time.
