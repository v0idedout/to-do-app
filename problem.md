# UX Interview & Problem Finding

---

## The Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Sam, you mentioned that you often rely on "mental math" to track your tasks. Can you walk me through a specific time recently when that mental math failed you or caused a spike in stress?
**Sam:** Usually after the "peak" days, after coming home from different after-school programs, I often can't focus extra on assignments anymore after.

**Interviewer:** When you're in that exhausted state after a "Peak Day," and you realize you have a high-stakes assignment due soon, what is the very first thing you typically do (or feel) when you look at your workload?
**Sam:** I tend to get it done anyways since I feel as if I don't have much of a choice, but feel a sense of dread while doing said assignment as if I'm running out of time.

**Interviewer:** Since you feel forced to push through that dread, how does the work you produce in those exhausted hours compare to what you know you're actually capable of when you have a "Gap Day"?
**Sam:** I perform worse than what I want to compared to the "gap days" when I have more time and energy to focus.

**Interviewer:** When you finally hit one of those "Gap Days" where you actually have the energy to do deep work, how do you decide which of the many tasks you've been "mental math-ing" to tackle first?
**Sam:** It's mainly dependent on the upcoming deadline and which one is first if there are multiple tasks.

**Interviewer:** If you had a tool that could "look ahead" at your week, what is the one thing it could tell you on a Monday morning that would actually lower that sense of dread you feel on Peak Days?
**Sam:** Reminders for future deadlines, or a pre-determined schedule according to my free times.

## Interview Synthesis

The interview reveals a clear **Performance-Energy Gap**. Sam is highly capable but is currently operating in a "reactive" state. Because "Peak Days" drain their cognitive battery, they are forced to complete high-stakes work in a state of exhaustion, leading to a "sense of dread" and lower-quality output.

On "Gap Days," Sam has the energy but lacks a strategic system, resorting to basic deadline triage. The core need isn't just a list of dates—it's **predictive offloading**. Sam needs the system to do the "looking ahead" so they can focus entirely on the quality of the work when they actually have the energy to do it.

## Problem Statements

* **Sam** is an **ambitious, high-achieving junior** who needs **a pre-determined schedule that aligns tasks with their actual free windows** because **mental math fails during peak-day exhaustion, leading to a performance gap where their work doesn't reflect their true capabilities.**
* **Sam** is a **time-constrained student with high cognitive load** who needs **automated reminders and foresight into future deadlines** because **the dread of running out of time forces them into a reactive "triage" mode that sacrifices quality for completion.**
